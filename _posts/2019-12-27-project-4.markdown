description: Statistical Process Control is an application designed to manage business processes with statistical tools. Engineers at plants could control process variables to manage production within Six Sigma levels, for instance, or environmental engineers could control attributes to lower the carbon footprint. In the next phase of development, we plan to incorporate machine learning to make the application intelligent.
